# Life-Savings
Authored by David McVicar, Joshua Spencer, Nick Love, and Douglas Applegate.
Final Project for CS480 Android Development at James Madison Universtiy

Life Savings is an app that allows users to see what effect their diet and excercise
has on their financial future. Unhealthier lifestyles are expensive, especially as 
healthcare costs continue to increase. Our goal is to motivate people to life healthier
lifestyles by giving them a financial perspective.
